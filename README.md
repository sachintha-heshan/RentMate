## 2nd Year 2nd Sem ITP Project
## Project Name - Online Marketplace For Homestays
### Project Description

```
Our client is Mr. N.T.D.T. Nallaperuma and he is a SaaS service provider. He has an idea to bridge the gap between
people who are looking for rental properties and property owners. This provides a platform for property owners to rent
out their homes, rooms, apartments etc. Also, if they want a transport their belongings from one place to another or if
they are looking for place where to buy furniture’s they can find nearest furniture showroom through our website. This
platform will empower property owners to earn extra income by listing their homestays on the website and renting them
out, and it will also provide people to new and unique experiences. However, there is a need for a centralized platform
that makes it easy for people to find and book the perfect homestay for their needs.

To address this gap in the market, we are developing an online marketplace for homestays. Our platform will allow
people to search and book a wide variety of homestays offered by local hosts. We will also provide a user-friendly
interface for local hosts to list their properties and experiences, manage their bookings. Our goal is to provide a
comprehensive solution that meets the needs of both people and local hosts.

We will build our online marketplace using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This
technology stack provides a robust and scalable solution that can handle the demands of a growing platform. Our web
application will be highly responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, providing users with a
seamless and convenient experience no matter how they access the platform. The user interface will be designed with
simplicity and ease-of-use in mind, making it easy for people and local hosts to navigate and use the platform with
confidence.
